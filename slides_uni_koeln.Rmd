# Background

# Why confidence intervals?

DESeq2 does a good job with interval hypothesis

--

We might want to order genes by LFC

# Frequentist calibration of CIs

In x% of repetitions of the exact same experiment, x% confidence interval will contain the true value.

???

Assuming the model is correct. Needs to hold for any parameters! -> Worst case, asymptotic results, bounds

---

# Bayesian calibration

Averaged over the prior, x% credible interval will contain the true value x% of the time.

???

Assuming the model is correct. Can be exact.



---

# The secret frequentists don't want you to know

1) Define likelihood

2) Maximize likelihood

3) ????

4) Profit!

3) ~~????~~ Compute Hessian

4) ~~Profit!~~ Assume normality

5) Publish!

# Bayesian interpretation of DESeq2

Frequentist models $\simeq$ Bayesian models

--

- Flat priors

- Posterior is normal


???

DESeq2 was intended as Empirical Bayes (maybe screenshot).
Note that this is the same assumption as before!

# Priors for the DESeq2 model

$$
\begin{align}
y_{g,s} &\sim \mathrm{NegBinomial\_2}(\mu_{g,s} r_s, \frac{1}{\tau_g}) \\
\mu_{g,s} &= X_s \beta  \\
\log \tau_g &\sim \mathrm{N} \left(\frac{a}{\mu_{g}} + b, \sigma_\tau \right) \\
\end{align}
$$

--

$$
\beta \sim \mathrm{N}(0,1)
$$

$$
\sigma_\tau \sim \mathrm{HalfN(0, 1)} ; a \sim \Gamma(3, 6) ; b \sim \Gamma(4, 2.3)
$$

???

Note that we are in between estimating dispersion and known dispersion

# Results

???

Only showing some settings, but results broadly consistent

---


# 3 replicates, default settings

- I.e. using the `apeglm` Student's T shrinkage



.large_fig[
![](3_apeglm_coverage.png)
]



---

# 3 replicates, default settings

Coverage of 95% CI: 91%

.large_fig[
![](3_apeglm_diff.png)
]


---

# 3 replicates, no shrinkage

Coverage of 95% CI: 94%

.large_fig[
![](3_none_diff.png)
]

???

We are kind to the frequentist, because we are not testing all possible values.

---

# 3 replicates, T

Coverage of 95% CI: 98%

.large_fig[
![](3_apeglm_t_diff.png)
]

---

# 20 replicates, default settings

Coverage of 95% CI: 93.5%

.large_fig[
![](20_apeglm_diff.png)
]


---

# Multiple comparisons

Correction for multiple comparisons applies also to CIs!

--

E.g., for the 3 replicates without shrinkage:

95% CI coverage:  94%

95% CI coverage when p < 0.1:  67%

---

# DESeq - conclusions

- The CIs of DESeq2 can be slightly miscalibrated

--

  - Especially with few replicates

--

  - p-values still valid

--

- Bayesian interpretation of DESeq2 results is _somewhat_ possible
  
--

- Correct CIs for multiple comparisons
